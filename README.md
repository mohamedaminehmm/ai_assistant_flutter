# Android Command Classifier - Experimental Prototype

## 🔧 Project Status
**Experimental / Work in Progress**  
Current input: Text only  
Voice command integration planned later

---

## 📖 About
This project explores how mobile apps can use simple **ML/NLP-style logic** to classify user commands and trigger Android actions — all running locally on the device without cloud APIs.

The goal is to experiment with on-device command classification and Android automation.

## ✅ Features (What Works)
- Intent classification
- Opens supported apps
- Performs Google searches
- Opens the dialer
- Creates TXT notes
- Opens calendar for reminders

---

## ❌ Missing / Planned Features
- No microphone / voice input yet
- Some apps may not open on all devices
- Further improvements in command classification accuracy

---

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to explore:
- Basic NLP and rule-based command classification
- Android intents and permissions
- Local automation without cloud dependencies

Even as a text-only prototype, it demonstrates practical ML/NLP experimentation and mobile integration.
